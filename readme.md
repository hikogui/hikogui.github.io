[Take Vos](https://github.com/takev/) started this library to make a portable,
high performance and modern looking GUI framework. Which may be used in
proprietary applications through the [BSL-1.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSL-1.0).

It is specifically designed to display dynamic information at the screen's
refresh rate. Special care is taken for making it easy for GUI element to
observe and modify data external to the GUI.
